# Bike Accidents project
Data Science with Python (EFREI Paris) - The goal of this project was to provide a data study using a CSV file. 
The subject was deliberately chosen by each student in the class, I decided to talk about bike accidents in France. The file I took is issued from the official website of the french government that provides multiple datasets concerning various subjects. This file contains data about bike accidents in France from 2005 to 2018, in which at least one person on a bike was involved. 
All the data was registered by the national police forces, who intervened on the locations of the accidents. This dataset was first published in 2019, and last updated in 2021.

The repository contains the following files :
  - *accidents-velos.csv* / The CSV file containing bike accidents data.
  - *analyse.ipynb* / A Jupyter Notebook file in which is written my code.
  - *presentation.pptx* (Ã  modifier) / The presentation powerpoint that served as support for the oral presentation.
